In this python coding exercise, using Kind County Dataset from Kaggle.com to predict house selling price by Regression algorithm.
Machine Learning techniques used: EDA, outliers removal, model selection (Linear Regression, KNN, XGBoost), data scaling, hyperparameter tuning(GridSearchCV), model evaluation(MSE, RMSE, R2), correlation visualization between actual price and predicted price by scatter plot.
